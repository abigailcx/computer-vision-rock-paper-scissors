# **Computer Vision: Rock, Paper, Scissors** :fist: :scroll: :scissors:

## Contents
This repo contains:
- `game_rps.py`: a multi-round OOP version of the game that can be played with either the keyboard or the camera
- `manual_rps.py`: a version which only takes in keyboard input and plays 1 round of the game.

## How to Play

### Logic of the Game
Play the classic game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer, using either your camera or keyboard input to show your move.
The code follows the classic rock, paper, scissors game logic where rock beats scissors, paper beats rock and scissors beats paper.

### Run the Code

#### Set up the Environment

### How to Win


## The Model

When using the camera mode to play, the game uses an image classification model to take the image of the player's move and predict which move it is. The code finds the highest probability in an array generated by Keras in which  
uses this prediction to compute the winner.
The model is trained with Google's Teachable Machine. 500 images were used for each of the 4 categories:
- Rock
- Paper
- Scissors
- Nothing

## The Code


# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Extras
get labels method

increasing number of game rounds

including the option to play either with the user's typed input or their camera input.

adding time.sleep() function in order to give the player a break between rounds.

Prompting the user whether they want to play another game

Final milestone contents:
Talk about how you integrated your game with the model, also talk about what more you could have done to improve the functionality of the game.

Make sure you add images or screenshots of the game to your README file.
